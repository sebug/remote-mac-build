# Remote Mac Build
Remember [tpgl](https://github.com/sebug/tpgl)? I want to be able to remotely
build (and optionally test it).

I'm starting with a connection to a MacStadium Mac Mini and try to install
all prerequisites in an automatic way (so XCode and Xamarin).

I'm learning as I go along, so if you come here early there may be better
solutions down the road.
